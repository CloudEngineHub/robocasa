This is the official RoboCasa codebase. Please refer to the accompanying [paper]() and [project website](https://robocasa.github.io/robocasa-web-dev/) for additional information.

-------
## Installation
RoboCasa works across all major computing platforms. Follow the instructions below to set up:
1. Set up conda environment:

   ```conda create -c conda-forge -n robocasa python=3.9```
3. Activate conda environment:

   ```conda activate robocasa```
5. Clone and setup robosuite dependency (**important: use the robocasa_v0.5 branch!**):

   ```git clone https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite-dev -b robocasa_v0.5; cd robosuite-dev; pip install -e .```
7. Clone and setup this repo:

   ```git clone https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa; cd robocasa; source setup.sh```

-------
## Quick start
Run demo script: `python -m robocasa.demos.demo_kitchens`

**(Mac users: preprend the "python" command with "mj": `mjpython ...`)**

Please note the following:
- If using keyboard: ensure the MuJoCo window isn't the "active" window, otherwise the MuJoCo viewer keybindings will interfere. Press a background window (eg. desktop) and then proceed with pressing key strokes.
- If using spacemouse: you may need to modify the product id to your appropriate model, setting `SPACEMOUSE_PRODUCT_ID` in `robocasa/macros_private.py`
